# Brain_tumor_detection
The Brain  Tumor detection is a machine learning project created by myself  that classifies 2D brain scan images as tumorous or not. Our model was built with Tensorflow, utilizing the Keras API. After training, an image passed to the model will produce a prediction of either 1 (tumorous) or 0 (non-tumorous).
